# Jessica Danger

Jessica is crossing the street and huge truck is speeding and is about to run her over, Fuji see's this about to happen and thinks if he should jump in and attempt to save her or mind his own business. What should he do?

(This is not a bug if you were already here that means you picked the wrong choice and now have to restart, choose wisely)
